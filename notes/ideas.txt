so basically we need:
- target that gets inside circles:
    origin, radius, mass
  and returns for each one
    center - position after movements

we need probably to have input.txt and output.txt that should be passed to program
std streams aren't that reliable

- test target, after running this one we can know that everything is fine. 
    also we could run some tests with this one
    
    
circle_separation - main library
circle_separation_test - executable for testing purposes
circle_separation_app - executable for running purposes
